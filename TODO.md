##TODO

As a user I should be able to:

- View a list of breweries
- Click a specific brewery to view information
- Filter the list of breweries by name or adress

This concludes the role of our product owner. 
Our tech lead now takes a quick look at these stories and tells us that we should split our app into the following React components:

- App: the app itself. This will also be responsible for all state.
- Breweries: responsible for rendering the list of breweries. The list of breweries are passed in as props. The function to call when a brewery is selected is also passed in as props.
- Brewery detail view;
- Maps view;
- Filter: allows the user to enter some text. The function to call when text is entered is passed in as props.
